<h2>Life of a loser</h2>
	<div><p>
			Well the loser we are going to talk about is a Failure from a tiny country called <b>Nepal</b>.<br>
			His name is Samrat Adhikari. Unlike European or lets say Western countries, the 1st part of a Nepali person is his <i>"calling name"</i> and the last or more likely second part of his name is his <i><b>"surname"</b></i>. The word "Samrat" means <i><b>"Emperor"</b></i> in English translation.   <br>
			he is a teen with a different view towards the world lives. He is a jerk who challenges the system every time. And he always wants to prove himself right.
